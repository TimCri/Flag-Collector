# Flag Collector: Hide the Flag CTF

## 🎯 Inspiration
The project was inspired by **Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions** and the idea of making a beginner-friendly challenge. We wanted to create something fun that helps people practice **code inspection** skills while interacting with a playful interface.

## 🧩 What it does
Flag Collector hides a secret flag split into **three parts** across different files:
- **HTML** → one part hidden in a comment.  
- **CSS** → another part disguised in styling.  
- **JavaScript** → a final piece embedded in the script.  

Players must explore the source code to find each part and assemble the full flag.

## 🛠️ How we built it
- **HTML** provides the structure and hides the first clue.  
- **CSS** controls the look and embeds the second clue.  
- **JavaScript** adds animations (like the ⭐ and 🐸) and contains the third clue.  
- **Extra pages** (`instructions.html` and `hint.html`) were added to guide players without spoiling the challenge.  

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into
- Making the flag parts **hidden but still discoverable** for beginners.  
- Ensuring animations were smooth across different browsers.   

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Built a **self-contained mini CTF challenge** that teaches basic inspection skills.  
- Designed a **playful interface** with subtle animations to keep the challenge engaging.  
- Successfully split and hid the flag across **HTML, CSS, and JS**.  

## 📚 What we learned
- How to creatively use **comments, styles, and scripts** for puzzle design.  
- The importance of **user experience** when building learning-focused challenges.  
- How small details (like placement of the frog and star) add personality to the project.  

## 🚀 What's next for Flag Collector
- Add **more levels** with harder challenges, such as obfuscated code or encoded text.  
- Introduce **automated flag validation** so players know when they’ve solved it.  
- Expand into a **series of mini-CTFs** for teaching web security basics.
